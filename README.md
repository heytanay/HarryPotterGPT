# HarryPotterGPT - My implementation of GPT trained on Harry Potter Data

I made this project thanks to Andrej Karpathy's excellent video on coding a GPT model from scratch. This project is my attempt to deeply understand how GPT works under-the-hood by coding it myself and training it on all Harry Potter books (Volume 1 - 7).

When the training is finished, this model should be able to generate text in style of Harry Potter.

The total training data is roughly 7MB in size.
